# Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Product Time Series Forecasting
Modeling Cross-Series Dependencies and Temporal Dynamics in Retail Supply-Chain Data
I use a real-world supply-chain example - forecasting sales for multiple products over time - to dive deep into how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their Temporal extensions really work, even down to the mathematical core. Imagine you have three related products: a spike in one often ripples into the others. We'll walk through how you build and train a sparse graph learner, apply graph convolutions, and then layer on temporal filters so you see not just code but the "why" behind each equation.
Traditional time-series tools like ARIMA or exponential smoothing treat each product in isolation, assume linear trends, and demand stationarity or data transformations. They struggle when dozens of products interact or when you need to plug in extra signals - promotions, holidays, or weather. Temporal GNNs solve these issues by learning a dynamic network of product relationships and capturing complex patterns across time, all in one end-to-end model. You won't just run a package - you'll understand how the graph adjacency is born from your data and why the temporal convolution uncovers hidden rhythms.
Beyond supply chains, GNNs and Temporal GNNs can be applied in many industries: predicting electricity load across regions, modeling traffic flows between intersections, or optimizing product recommendations in e-commerce. Along the way, I'll highlight innovations in sparse graph regularization, discuss how to extend to uncertainty estimates, and suggest next steps - like adaptive graph updates and real-time retraining. This post isn't just a how-to; it's a springboard for new ideas. Let's get started.
